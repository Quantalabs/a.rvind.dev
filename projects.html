        The robot I worked on as part of my old team,

        Crescendo season.

        I'm currently a member of Red Tie Robotics (FRC #1458), and have thus
        developed numerous FRC-focused projects over the past 2 seasons in FRC.
        Namely, frustrations regarding the default dashboard's and their layouts
        prompted me to create my own dashboard using Svelte, called
        <a href="https://github.com/FRC1458/lemonade">Lemonade</a>. I plan on
        extending this to include integration with custom button board for robot
        control, as well as modularizing the dashboard to better fit other
        teams' needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my freshman year at the Ragin' C-Biscuits (FRC #1280), I developed
        the
        <a href="https://github.com/Team-1280/FIRSTScouting">infrastructure</a>
        for storing, viewing, and managing scouting data from
        <a href="https://github.com/PWNAGERobotics/ScoutingPASS">ScoutingPASS</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the past year, I've been a member of Hack Club, and have developed
        some projects for various events. As a result, I worked on my first
        hardware project, a simple macropad called
        <a href="https://github.com/Quantalabs/basmati">Basmati</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also created
        <a href="https://github.com/Quantalabs/ElectionBook">ElectionBook</a>, a
        web app that analyzed the 2024 U.S. presidential election using google
        search and news data in the months, weeks, and days preceding the
        election.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also created
        <a href="https://github.com/Quantalabs/epispot">epispot</a>, which is a
        package for modeling infectious diseases in TS/JS.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, I create various small utilities and projects for personal use,
        such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/Quantalabs/diet">Diet</a>, which helps me
          update my GitHub profile with my favorite research papers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/Quantalabs/.files">.files</a>, which
          contains my Arch Linux system configuration (I use arch, btw).
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/Quantalabs/a.rvind.dev">a.rvind.dev</a>,
          this website.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For new projects, I'm particularly interested in finding ideas that mix
        my passions of music and math, as well as more applying my programming
        skills to other disciplines, like physics or chemistry. I'm also trying
        to develop more complex PCBs and hardware projects, such as my own
        <a href="https://github.com/Quantalabs/mantam">guitar pedal</a>.
