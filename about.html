        <p>
          Hello, I'm Arvind! I'm a high school junior with interests in math,
          music, physics, and CS (not necessarily in that order).
        </p>
        <p>
          I find myself particularly drawn to the intersection of these fields,
          such as applying math to music via musical set or transformational
          theory, or using CS to model and analyze mathematical, biological, or
          physical processes.
        </p>
        <p>
          I spend a lot of my time building small (open source) projects,
          learning various niche topics that I eventually realize are too
          complex for me to understand, composing/performing music, and doing
          homework (often times in that order).
        </p>
        <h2 class="header">Principles</h2>
        <p>
          I believe in the Free Software Foundation's philosophy surrounding
          free and open source software. My system thus minimizes proprietary
          code (and I've avoided NVIDIA like the plague), and I have tried to
          maximize my open source contributions and documentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm also an Arch Linux user (btw). I value simplicity, efficiency, and
          practicality above all else. Thus, I am also a Rustacean and program
          and use Rust projects when possible (e.g. Typst, Tauri, Helix).
        </p>
        <p>
          In terms of my academic interests, I value intuition over formalism.
          Often, it's been the gaps in my intuition that motivate me to
          investigate topics and discover new ideas and ways of thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, I'm a composer and musician, and thus music to me is not
          "organized sound". For me, it is a medium for communicating meaning
          through sound. Hyper-theoretical and overly complex music means
          nothing without a central message or theme, but sound that conveys
          such meaning, to me, at least, is music.<sup>1</sup>

                If I were a Springer-Verlag Graduate Text in Mathematics, I
                would be Bela Bollobas's <b><i>Modern Graph Theory</i></b
                >.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am an in-depth account of graph theory, written with the
                student in mind; I reflect the current state of the subject and
                emphasize connections with other branches of pure mathematics.
                Recognizing that graph theory is one of several courses
                competing for the attention of a student, I contain extensive
                descriptive passages designed to convey the flavor of the
                subject and to arouse interest.
